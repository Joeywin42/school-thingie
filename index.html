        <h1>Nature Thingie</h1>
        <p1>I decided to make a website from scratch for some reason and will just have this be a basic thing</br>
              where I show some pictures and describe them. I really liked how hungry I was while making this.</p1>
        </br>
        <p> Please don't find my house from these images somehow, and if you do give me free food or something.</p>

        <p1>This is a picture of my backyard/garage into the road. In my opinion the greenery is kinda meh but</p1></br> 
            the road gets its job done. </p1>

        <p1>My house only has one side to look at lol, and I do quite enjoy looking at it, It has a nice sidewalk.</br>
            It integrates my backyard/garage to the frontyard which provides a solid view and I like how the sidewalk is just a sidewalk being slightly</br>
            overtaken by the surrounding plants by it.</p1>

        <br />
        <p1>This is the front of my house, I cut out the front part(address) for obvious reasons.</br>
            I never noticed the elephant, so it must be new and my favorite hamster was buried here.</br>
            The bushes is fun</p1>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p1>This is the view I get when I check for mail in the front of my house. I actaully never see this road because my back is how I exit</br>
            I get to see some trees, but the best part is when I see some cute puppies. Somethimes when I look out this I get a little nostalgic. </br>
             I dont do it as much but its always nice to remember the past.</p1>

        <p1>This is my hamster his name is SushiDon and he is really cute. </p1>
        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p1>I honestly have no Idea why I did a website it took more than 250 words to write down like 250 words and it probably isnt 250 words.</b>
            But that should be it, this was pretty darn hard to make</b></p1>
